## Understanding the Workflow: Integrating "MyAwesomeMicroservice"

In this guide, we're delving into the seamless integration and automation processes for our microservice, aptly named "MyAwesomeMicroservice." Our objectives are multifaceted, ensuring a streamlined approach to development, testing, and deployment. Here's what we aim to accomplish:

1. **Automated Build Process:** Streamline the assembly procedure to automatically compile the code, handle dependencies, and establish an artifact repository for version consistency.  
2. **Test Environment Configuration:** Establish a docker-compose file that effortlessly stands up the entire necessary environment for testing, inclusive of a SQL server instance, mimicking production parity.
    
> [!IMPORTANT]
> For an in-depth understanding and additional context, explore the GitHub Actions workflows.
> This will explain why the Dockerfile looks different from our normal Dockerfiles. This is optimized for Build/Deployments.

### Creating the Compose File for Test Environment
The creation of the docker-compose file is instrumental in orchestrating our services, including the crucial SQL server for our testing phase. 

> [!WARNING]
> Pay special attention to the environment variables and network settings within the compose file. Misconfigurations here could lead to incongruities between test and production environments.
